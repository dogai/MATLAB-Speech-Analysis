This MATLAB code is designed to analyze speech files and calculate three key metrics: 
    - Short-Time Energy, 
    - Short-Time Magnitude, and 
    - Short-Time Zero-crossing.

The uploaded files consist of:
    - MATLAB code for performing the calculations.
    - Two sample speech files for testing purposes.
    - A project report detailing the task, including explanations, code screenshots, output screenshots, 
      and rationale behind the chosen values for window size, window shifts, and window.
